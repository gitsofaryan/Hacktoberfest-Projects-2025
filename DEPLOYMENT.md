# üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your Singly Linked List Game to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Basic knowledge of Git commands

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create a New Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., `singly-linked-list-game`)
5. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Upload Your Files

#### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface
1. In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all your project files:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `README.md`
   - `.gitignore`
3. Add a commit message: "Initial commit: Singly Linked List Game"
4. Click "Commit changes"

#### Option B: Using Git Command Line
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/singly-linked-list-game.git
cd singly-linked-list-game

# Copy your project files to this directory
# (index.html, styles.css, script.js, README.md, .gitignore)

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Singly Linked List Game"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (or click "Pages" in the left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`)
6. Click **Save**

### 4. Wait for Deployment

- GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
- This usually takes 1-5 minutes
- You'll see a green checkmark when deployment is complete

### 5. Access Your Game

Your game will be available at:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/singly-linked-list-game
```

## üéØ Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. In the Pages settings, enter your domain in the "Custom domain" field
2. Add a CNAME record in your domain provider's DNS settings
3. Point it to `yourusername.github.io`

## üîÑ Updating Your Game

To update your game after making changes:

### Using GitHub Web Interface
1. Navigate to the file you want to edit
2. Click the pencil icon to edit
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with a descriptive message

### Using Git Command Line
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Make your changes to files

```

## üêõ Troubleshooting
